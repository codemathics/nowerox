                            <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Nowerox Nigeria Limited</span> carries out stop and repair of external corrosion, dents, gouges, erosion, or other defects in piping systems. With NNL composite solutions piping systems are restored to their Maximum Allowable Operating Pressure (MAOP) regardless of surface irregularities (welds, dents, sleeves etc) piping configuration (tees, elbows and reducers) internal or external wall loss. NNL also offers complete and permanent repairs to tanks, welds, and infrastructure components such as bridge columns, pilings, and poles. NNL composite wrap systems meet the engineering design requirements of DOT, ASME B31.4/31.8, and ASME PCC-2 and provide our clients with a permanent repair alternative to welded sleeves, bolt on repair clamps and or pipe replacement. The NNL Composite Wrap for pipeline repairs allow plant owners and operators to restore corroded or eroded pipe and piping systems to original design without the expense and hassle of extended down-times.
                            <br>
                            The structural system forms a pipe around a pipe, and each successive wrap increases the pressure rating. Its bidirectional weave allows for strength in both the hoop and axial directions experiencing little or no creep properties over time, ensuring that there is no reduction in strength. NNL Composite Wrap low profile repair can be installed on tees, elbows, straight runs of pipe, confined spaces and irregular surfaces that require structural reinforcement or leak containment. The adhesive properties of the epoxy allow wrap systems to be applied to most substrates.

                            <p>The environmental and societal impact of infrastructure failure is a primary consideration for today’s pipeline operators. This is why over the years, NNL  has focused on providing corrosion prevention design, engineering, supply and field services to its clients.<br>

                            Cathodic protection is the most common electrochemical technique used to prevent corrosion on buried metallic pipelines where the applied coating has failed or been damaged exposing bare pipeline metal to the soil. Protection is accomplished by applying a direct current to the surface of the metal, which causes the electrochemical potential of the structure to shift from a corroding state to a polarised and non-corroding state<br>

                            NNL also specializes in providing corrosion control materials. All of our activities are performed under the direct supervision of Professional Engineers. We have a full service Engineering Department capable in all phases of corrosion control projects. Our Engineering Department in conjunction with our Construction and Survey Departments allow NNL to offer "Turn Key" services to our clients. All of our activities are performed by Professional Engineers.

                            <p>When it comes to integration of a pressure test unit into your assembly verification application, turn to Nowerox Nig. Ltd.  (NNL). With our years of experience in design and build, along with our integration of pressure test applications using methods like hydrostatic testing to proof testing, and ranging from 5 inches of water to 30,000 PSI, you can be rest assured your test performance is optimized with the utmost safety in mind.<br>
                            NNL has extensive experience in pressure testing Oil and Gas facilities,	
                            and other industry applications over the years. We will work with you to 
                            determine the best method to use, whether it is one of our pressure 
                            testing units or some other method to achieve your testing goals.<br>
                            During facility maintenance turnarounds, nitrogen is used during shutdown to purge dangerous gases or liquids from vessels, towers, and tanks, which leaves an inert atmosphere for safer maintenance.

                            Prior to plant start-up nitrogen is again used to remove oxygen from process systems reducing the potential of fire or explosion.<br>

                            Displacement pigs are inserted into pipelines and propelled by nitrogen gas to remove natural gas, crude oil, gasoline, diesel fuel, LPG and other explosive products leaving the pipeline in a clean, dry, and inert state.<br>

                            Dry nitrogen is also ideal for removing water after hydro-testing to protect moisture sensitive products such as ethylene or chlorine from contamination.
